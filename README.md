Self Reflection

I have learnt that web designing is not an easy job. If I want to make something look the way I want, I'll probably have to change many elements for it to look even close to perfect.
Developer tools is one's best friend when it comes to web designing. It took me 1/8th of a day to take in what I had to do, a good night's sleep to figure out what had to be done, and 10 hours of continous working to make the webpage provided here.
I wish my future self the very best of luck because I will have to work hard, and make tons of sacrifices (my eyes will never forgive me).
